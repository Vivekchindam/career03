Branching strategies:
============================

main
dev
feature


error 
release 
==============================

Basic Git ==> SCM

developers ==> code implementation based on the application ==> using git branching strategies 

main===> dev ==> feature 

user ==> feature ==> dev ==> git merge ==>
dev ==> main ==> git merge ==> 

error ==> error branch ==> dev code issue fix==> once issue as been fixed error branch delete

git delete branchname 

===> release == release branch ===  branch as been delete 

===========================

= trying to develop the code 

===working are write==> staging area move with help of git add ==> local repo changes move==> with help of git commit -m ""
===> changes remote repo move ==> with help of git push origin branchname

======> ask for GitHub credentials ==>

=============================

when we are working in working area we need to undo the changes

==> git checkout filename

when we are in staging are how we undo the changes 
==> git reset

when we are in local how we undo the changes
==> git rebase commit modify

==> local orginal ==> change made staging ==> working 
git diff

==================
initial time we are clone the GitHub repo using the command as

git clone repo url

==next time onwards we using the command for clone

git pull url


===once change made send back to the code to remote
git push origin main

==============================================================
Hi all welcome to devops
Today we are explore the topic as Git

Git have stage
local area
working area
stageing are
local are
push the changes to remote


working are change to staging == using add
staging are changes to local repo == commit -m 
local changes to remote area github ==  using push
